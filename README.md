# Customizable PullToRefresh

This component implements pure pull-to-refresh logic and you can use it for developing your own pull-to-refresh animations, [like this one.](https://github.com/Yalantis/PullToMakeSoup)

[![Yalantis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yalantis/PullToRefresh/develop/PullToRefreshDemo/Resources/badge_dark.png)](https://yalantis.com/?utm_source=github)

## Requirements

- iOS 8.0+
- Swift 3 (v. 2.0+)
- Swift 2 (v. 1.4)

## Installing with [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)

```ruby
use_frameworks!
pod 'PullToRefresher', '~> 2.0'
```

## Usage

At first, import PullToRefresh:

```swift
import PullToRefresh
```

The easiest way to create *PullToRefresh*:

```swift
let refresher = PullToRefresh()
```

It will create a default pull-to-refresh with a simple view which has single *UIActivitiIndicatorView*. To add refresher to your *UIScrollView* subclass:

```swift
tableView.addPullToRefresh(refresher) {
    // action to be performed (pull data from some source)
}
```

⚠️ Don't forget to remove pull to refresh when your view controller is releasing. ⚠️

```swift
deinit {
    tableView.removePullToRefresh(at: .top)
}
```

After the action is completed and you want to hide the refresher:

```swift
tableView.endRefreshing()
```

You can also start refreshing programmatically:

```swift
tableView.startRefreshing()
```

But you probably won’t use this component, though. *UITableViewController* and *UICollectionViewController* already have a simple type of refresher.
It’s much more interesting to develop your own pull-to-refresh control.

## Creating custom PullToRefresh

To create a custom refresher you would need to initialize *PullToRefresh* class with two objects:

- **refreshView** is a UIView object which will added to your scroll view;
- **animator** is an object which will animate elements on refreshView depending on the state of PullToRefresh.

```swift
let awesomeRefresher = PullToRefresh(refresherView: yourView, animator: yourAnimator)
```

### Steps for creating custom PullToRefresh

1) Create a custom *UIView* with *.xib and add all images that you want to animate as subviews. Pin them with outlets:

```swift
class RefreshView: UIView {

    @IBOutlet private var imageView: UIImageView!
  
    // and others
}
```

2) Create an *Animator* object that conforms *RefreshViewAnimator* protocol and can be initialized by your custom view:

```swift
class Animator: RefreshViewAnimator {

    private let refreshView: RefreshView
    
    init(refreshView: RefreshView) {
        self.refreshView = refreshView
    }

    func animate(state: State) {
        // animate refreshView according to state
    }
}
```

3) According to RefreshViewAnimator protocol, your animator should implement *animateState* method. This method is get called by *PullToRefresh* object every time its state is changed. There are four states:

```swift
public enum State: Equatable, CustomStringConvertible {
    
    case initial
    case releasing(progress: CGFloat)
    case loading
    case finished
}
```

- **Initial** - refresher is ready to be pulled.
- **Releasing** - refresher is in the process of releasing (by a user or programmatically). This state contains a double value which represents releasing progress from 0 to 1.
- **Loading** - refresher is in the loading state.
- **Finished** - loading is finished.

Depending on the state that your animator gets from the *PullToRefresh*, it has to animate elements in *refreshView*:

```swift
func animate(state: State) {
    switch state {
      case .initial: // do inital layout for elements
      case .releasing(let progress): // animate elements according to progress
      case .loading: // start loading animations
      case .finished: // show some finished state if needed
    }
}
```

Place the magic of animations insted of commented lines.

4) For the convitience sake you can sublass from *PullToRefresh* and create separate class for your refresher:

```swift
class AwesomePullToRefresh: PullToRefresh {

    convenience init() {
        let refreshView = Bundle(for: type(of: self)).loadNibNamed("RefreshView", owner: nil, options: nil)!.first as! RefreshView
        let animator = Animator(refreshView: refreshView)
        self.init(refreshView: refreshView, animator: animator)
    }
}
```

5) Finally, add a refresher to a UIScrollView subclass:

```swift
tableView.addPullToRefresh(refresher) {
    // action to be performed (pull data from some source)
}
```

6) If used inside a UITableViewController with a UINavigationController:

Inside your subclass of UITableViewController, add this code and define your insets. UIEdgeInsets are handled differently in iOS 11 and than before, so we need this check:
```swift
self.automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets = false

if #available(iOS 11.0, *) {
    awesomeRefresher.navigationControllerHeight = (self.navigationController?.navigationBar.frame.size.height)! + UIApplication.shared.statusBarFrame.height

    self.tableView.contentInset = UIEdgeInsetsMake(0, 0, 0, 0)
    self.tableView.scrollIndicatorInsets = UIEdgeInsetsMake(0, 0, 0, 0)

} else {

    self.tableView.contentInset = UIEdgeInsetsMake(64, 0, 49, 0) // Here you should define your insets. 64 top and 49 bottom are default
    self.tableView.scrollIndicatorInsets = UIEdgeInsetsMake(64, 0, 49, 0)

}
```

Have fun! :)

## Let us know!

We’d be really happy if you sent us links to your projects where you use our component. Just send an email to github@yalantis.com And do let us know if you have any questions or suggestion regarding the animation. 

P.S. We’re going to publish more awesomeness wrapped in code and a tutorial on how to make UI for iOS (Android) better than better. Stay tuned!
